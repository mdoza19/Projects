# Projects

Created a Crawler to obtain show linksfrom a site. User can define which site they want to pull from and store the links in a file.
Later on if you run it again it can compare the amount of links previosuly retrieved vs the current links and if there is new episdoes create an event ( event not currently added working on it )

Db was created using sqlite3 and programs assumes there is a db with data in place.  i will probably a creation script later on.


This is an ongoing work.
